# Linkedin JS/CSS

## Summary
We're almost ready to launch our very own Linkedin Profile!

Copy over the code you wrote in the `index.html` from the LinkedIn HTML challenge. Try not to make any changes to it!

## Releases

### Release 0 - Link Up
Let's start by connecting our `script.js` and `style.css` files to our html document. Can you recall where in the document the link should be? Get some styling in your HTML file to make it look more like LinkedIn!

### Release 1 - Save some Selectors
Next, let's make sure we can query the document by selectors. choose an element(or set of) and make four variables that hold the result of calling document.
- [getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
- [getElementsByClassName](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName)
- [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)
- [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)

### Release 2 - Traverse
Based on your above selectors, try to use a few JS methods to move along the DOM tree.

### Release 3 - Manipulate
Using your above selectors:
- Manipulate the `innerHTML`
- Delete something
- Change CSS
- Add a CSS Property

### Release 4 - React (...not THAT react)
Create a few Event Listeners for your profile to react to when a person clicks on an important button, or hovers over your image. Check out the JS features for dropdowns and tabs in bootstrap, and implement one.

### Release 5 - Animate
You know the drill, take a selected element, and animate it!Perhaps you can connect your animation function with your previous EVENT LISTENERS??!
